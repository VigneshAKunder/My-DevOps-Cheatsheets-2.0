o Symptoms: Load balancer reports instances as unhealthy.
o Resolution: Inspect CloudWatch metrics for instances, troubleshoot application 
health checks, and ensure instances are registered with the correct load balancer. 
Check security group settings and troubleshoot application health.

4. Route 53: DNS Resolution Issues
o Symptoms: Domain not resolving or pointing to the wrong IP address.
o Resolution: Verify Route 53 records for accuracy. Check DNS propagation and TTL 
settings. Confirm the health of associated resources (e.g., Load Balancer, EC2 
instances). Investigate any issues reported in Route 53 health checks.

5. CloudWatch: Alarm Triggering Incorrectly

What are the differences between ECS and EKS ?

Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) and Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) are both container orchestration services provided by AWS, but they differ significantly in their architecture, usage, and underlying technologies.

*ECS Easier to use for users who are already familiar with AWS and do not require Kubernetes-specific features.

*In EKS AWS manages the Kubernetes control plane (including etcd and API servers), but users have more control over the configuration and operation of their Kubernetes clusters. 

*ECS uses AWS-specific networking modes like bridge, host, and aws vpc.

*EKS utilizes Kubernetes networking models, allowing the use of Kubernetes-native networking plugins (CNI) like Calico or Weave

*ECS tightly integrated with AWS services like IAM, CloudWatch, Auto Scaling, ALB/NLB, and more. 

*EKS Also integrates well with AWS services, but the setup may require additional steps due to Kubernetes' flexibility. 

*ECS Best suited for users who need a straightforward, AWS-integrated container orchestration solution. Ideal for single-cloud applications running entirely on AWS.

*EKS Best for users who want to use Kubernetes' advanced features, run hybrid or multi-cloud applications, or migrate existing Kubernetes workloads to AWS.

*ECS offers scalable and automated solutions via service auto-scaling, and cluster auto-scaling. AWS Fargate can be used for serverless container deployments, removing the need to manage EC2 instances.

*EKS Kubernetes’ horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) and cluster autoscaling can be used for scalability. EKS also supports Fargate for serverless Kubernetes deployments.

*ECS has a smaller ecosystem compared to Kubernetes but benefits from strong AWS support and documentation.

*Kubernetes has a large, active open-source community with a vast ecosystem of tools, plugins, and extensions.

Here’s how you can list the best practices for IAM in AWS 

1. Follow the Principle of Least Privilege
 Always grant the minimum permissions required for users and roles to perform their tasks.

2. Use IAM Roles Instead of Access Keys
 Prefer IAM roles with temporary credentials over long-term access keys for services like EC2 or Lambda.

3. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
 Enforce MFA, especially for sensitive accounts like administrators.

4. Regularly Rotate Credentials
 Rotate passwords, access keys, and other credentials regularly. Remove inactive keys immediately.

5. Use Managed Policies Over Inline Policies
 Use AWS managed or customer-managed policies for reusability and easier management.

6. Monitor IAM Activity
 Use AWS CloudTrail and IAM Access Analyzer to monitor and log all IAM activity for security and auditing purposes.

7. Implement Permissions Boundaries
 Use permissions boundaries to limit the maximum permissions users or roles can have, even if granted more permissions by others.

8. Leverage AWS Organizations and Service Control Policies (SCPs)
 Use AWS Organizations to centrally manage permissions across multiple accounts by applying SCPs.

9. Use IAM Groups for Permission Management
 Assign permissions to groups rather than individual users to simplify access management.

10. Limit Root Account Usage
 Limit the use of the root account and enable MFA. Avoid using the root account for everyday tasks.

11. Review IAM Permissions Regularly
 Conduct periodic reviews of permissions to ensure only necessary access is granted.

12. Use Resource-Based Policies
 When needed, apply resource-based policies, such as for S3 buckets, to manage cross-account access efficiently.

13. Implement Policy Conditions
 Use conditions in policies, like IP address restrictions or requiring MFA, for more granular control.

14. Tag IAM Resources
 Tag IAM roles, users, and policies to easily track and manage them across your AWS environment.
