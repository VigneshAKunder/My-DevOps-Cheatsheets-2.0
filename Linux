In Linux file permissions: 

In Linux, file permissions control how users and groups can access and modify files and directories. Understanding these permissions is crucial for system security and data integrity.

There are three basic types of permissions in Linux:

 Read (r): Allows users to view the contents of a file.

 Write (w): Allows users to modify the contents of a file.

 Execute (x): Allows users to execute a file (if it's a program) or list the contents of a directory.

These permissions apply to three categories of users:
 Owner: Theof us user who created the file.
 Group: A group ers assigned to the file.
 Others: All other users on the system.
 
File permissions are represented by a string of characters, typically displayed using the ls -l command. 

Let's break down how to interpret this string:

 The first character: Indicates if it's a file (regular file denoted by '-') or a directory (represented by 'd').

 The next three characters: Represent the owner's permissions (read, write, execute).

 The next three characters: Represent the group's permissions.

 The last three characters: Represent the permissions for others.

Understanding file permissions is essential for maintaining system security in Linux. By setting appropriate permissions, you can restrict access to sensitive data and ensure the smooth operation of your system. 

=================================================================================================================================================================

To Understand about Linux need to know about it's file structure.
In linux each directory is unique. 
below are the main Linux directories.

Linux File structure:
--------------------
- file structure represents the flow of the Operating System.
- means what are the operations going on with particular Directory.

/ ->it is parent directory of all directories.
/root ->root user home directory
/bin ->binary information store here
/sbin ->system binary information
/boot ->booting directory
/dev ->devices information here
/etc ->all configurations stored here
/mnt ->mount directory
/opt ->optional apps 
/proc ->process information stores here
/sys ->system information 
/src ->service related information.
/var ->variable directory
/usr ->user applications
/media ->removable media information
/tmp ->temporary directory
/home ->users home directory

Linux File System - Essential Directories 

Here’s a quick guide to the key root directories and their purposes:

 /bin: Essential binaries for system boot and basic functions. Programs like bash and login reside here.

 /boot: Core assets needed to boot the system (e.g., bootloader, Linux Kernel Image).

 /proc: Virtual filesystem for running processes. Contains process-specific directories. Explore but don’t change anything.

 /var: Files of variable size/content.
Logs: /var/log
Web server assets: /var/www/html

 /mnt: Manually mounted devices.

 /media: Automatically mounted devices (e.g., USB drives).

 /dev: Files for all devices.
e.g. /dev/sda1 for new EBS volumes.
e.g. /dev/null for discarding output.

 /etc: System-wide configurations and boot scripts. Text-only and human-readable.

 /tmp: Temporary files, cleaned out on reboot. Do not store important data here.

 /lib: Libraries for programs in /bin.
Variation: /usr/lib for user-space programs.

 /root: Home directory for the root user. Normal users may not have access.

 /usr: Programs for Linux users.
Tip: Explore /usr/bin for user-space programs.

 /home: Home directories for regular users.
e.g. /home/shadan for user "shadan".
Access to other users directories depends on permissions.

Essential tool for scheduling tasks in Linux.

What is cron?
-->cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It allows users to schedule jobs (commands or scripts) to run automatically at specified times or intervals. These scheduled tasks are called "cron jobs."
Understanding crontab
-->crontab (short for "cron table") is a configuration file that specifies the schedule of cron jobs for individual users or the system. Each line in a crontab file represents a task and its corresponding schedule.
crontab Syntax
-->A typical crontab entry has the following structure:

* * * * * script/command/to/execute 
* * * * *
* * * * +---- Day of the week (0 - 7) (Sunday is both 0 and 7)
* * * +------ Month (1 - 12)
* * +-------- Day of the month (1 - 31)
* +---------- Hour (0 - 23)
+------------ Minute (0 - 59)

Each asterisk ("*") represents a time or date field, and the fields are separated by spaces. Here's what each field means:

1. Minute : The minute of the hour when the job will run (0-59).
2. Hour : The hour of the day when the job will run (0-23).
3. Day of the Month : The day of the month when the job will run (1-31).
4. Month : The month of the year when the job will run (1-12).
5. Day of the Week : The day of the week when the job will run (0-7), where both 0 and 7 represent Sunday.

Special Symbols in Crontab
1.     "*" : Wildcard, meaning "every possible value" for that field.
2.     "," : Separator, allows you to specify multiple values (e.g., "1,15" in the Day of the Month field means the 1st and 15th).
3.     "-" : Range, specifies a range of values (e.g., "1-5" in the Day of the Week field means Monday to Friday).
4.     "/" : Step, allows you to specify intervals (e.g., "*/2" in the Minute field means every 2 minutes).

Example Crontab Entries:

1. **Run a script every day at 2:30 AM:**
 30 2 * * * /path/to/script.sh
2. **Run a backup every Sunday at midnight:**
 0 0 * * 0 /path/to/backup.sh
3. **Run a command every 15 minutes:**
 */15 * * * * /path/to/command
4. **Run a job every weekday at 6:00 PM:**
 0 18 * * 1-5 /path/to/job.sh

Managing Crontab Files
- View Crontab :  crontab -l
- Edit Crontab : crontab -e
- Remove Crontab : crontab -r


System-wide Crontab
In addition to user-specific "crontab" files, there are system-wide cron jobs located in "/etc/crontab". This file contains jobs for all users and has an extra field specifying which user to run the job as:
* * * * * username command_to_execute

Log and Debugging
- Cron Logs: The cron daemon logs its activity, typically found in  “/var/log/syslog” on most systems. You can view logs with:
 grep cron /var/log/syslog
 
Output Redirection**: By default, cron does not produce any output. To capture the output of a cron job, you can redirect it to a file:
 * * * * * /path/to/script.sh > /path/to/logfile 2>&1
 Here, `2>&1` redirects both standard output and standard error to the same file.

=================================================================================================================================================================
Real-time troubleshooting in Linux:-

1. How would you troubleshoot a system that's running out of disk space?
Answer: Use the df command to see which partitions are full: df -h
This will show disk usage in a human-readable format.
Find large files: du -ah / | sort -rh | head -n 20
This command lists the top 20 largest files and directories.

2. How do you monitor CPU and memory usage in real time?
Answer: top: Provides a real-time view of CPU and memory usage
htop: A more user-friendly version of top (if installed)

3. How would you recover a system where the /etc/fstab file has been misconfigured, preventing the system from booting?
Answer: Boot into Rescue Mode or Single User Mode: Reboot the system and access the bootloader (GRUB).
Edit the boot options by adding single or rescue at the end of the kernel boot line to enter single-user mode.
You can specify init=/bin/bash in the GRUB boot parameters to get a basic shell with limited functionality.
Fix the /etc/fstab file: nano /etc/fstab
Remount the root filesystem: mount -o remount,rw /
Reboot: After fixing the file, reboot the system: reboot

4. How would you extend a logical volume and resize the filesystem?
Answer: Ensure you have free space in the volume group: vgdisplay
Extend the logical volume: lvextend -L +10G /dev/mapper/vg_name-lv_name
Resize the filesystem: resize2fs /dev/mapper/vg_name-lv_name
For xfs: xfs_growfs /mount/point

5. A user reports that their cron jobs are not running. How would you troubleshoot this issue?
Answer: Ensure the cron service is running: systemctl status cron
Verify the cron job syntax: List the cron jobs for the user: crontab -l -u username
Check cron logs: Cron jobs are logged in /var/log/syslog or /var/log/cron 

6. How would you troubleshoot a slow-performing server?
Answer: Check CPU usage: Use top or htop to check for high CPU usage: top
Identify any processes consuming excessive CPU and investigate further.
Check memory usage: free -m
Check for high swap usage, which might indicate memory pressure.

7. How would you reset a forgotten root password?
Answer: Boot into single-user mode. Reboot the system. When GRUB appears, press e to edit the boot options.
Find the line that starts with linux, append single or init=/bin/bash at the end, and boot.
Remount the root filesystem: In single-user mode, the root filesystem might be mounted as read-only. Remount it in read-write mode:
mount -o remount,rw / Change the root password: Use the passwd command to change the root password: passwd && reboot

8. How do you set file permissions recursively on a directory?
Answer: Change permissions on a directory and its contents: Use chmod with the -R option: chmod -R 755 /path/to/directory
Change ownership recursively: Use chown to change the owner and group of the directory and its contents: chown -R user:group /path/to/directory

9. How would you secure SSH access on a Linux server?
Answer: Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and disable root login: PermitRootLogin no
Change the default port (22) to something less common to reduce automated attacks: Port 2222
Disable password-based login by enforcing key-based authentication: PasswordAuthentication no

10. How do you recover a deleted file from a running process in Linux?
Answer: Use lsof to find the deleted file: lsof | grep deleted
Each running process has its file descriptors listed in /proc. You can copy the file from there:
cp /proc/1234/fd/4 /path/to/recover/file
This restores the deleted file while the process is still running.

11. How would you set up automatic backups using rsync and cron?
Answer: Write a simple backup script that uses rsync to synchronize directories:
#!/bin/bash
rsync -avz /source/directory /backup/directory
Save the script as backup.sh and make it executable: chmod +x backup.sh
Set up a cron job: Use crontab -e to open the cron configuration and add the following line to run the backup script every day at 2 AM:
0 2 * * * /path/to/backup.sh
Verify the cron job: Check the cron logs to ensure the backup is running as expected: grep CRON /var/log/syslog

12. How would you configure a Linux server to send out system alerts via email?
Answer: Install mailx or sendmail depending on your Linux distribution: sudo apt-get install mailutils 
Set up your SMTP server details in /etc/mail.rc or /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf to send emails.
Write a script that checks the server’s status and sends an email if a problem is detected:
#!/bin/bash
load=$(uptime | awk '{print $10}')
if (( $(echo "$load > 2.0" | bc -l) )); then
 echo "High CPU load detected: $load" | mail -s "Alert: High CPU Load" admin@example.com
fi
Schedule the alert: Use crontab -e to schedule the alert script to run every 5 minutes:
*/5 * * * * /path/to/alert.sh

13. How do you troubleshoot a Linux system that's running out of memory?
Answer: Check current memory usage: free -m
Identify memory-hogging processes: Use top or htop to find processes consuming large amounts of memory: top
Sort processes by memory usage: ps aux --sort=-%mem | head
Check for memory leaks: smem -r | head && pmap <pid>

14. How do you find and kill zombie processes in Linux?
Answer: You can use the ps command to find zombie processes: ps aux | grep Z
Zombies will have a Z in the status column.
Zombie processes are waiting for their parent process to reap them. To eliminate them, you can either wait for the parent process to handle them or kill the parent: kill -HUP <parent_pid>

15. How would you increase the maximum number of open file descriptors in Linux?
Answer: Use ulimit -n to check the current limit for the number of open file descriptors: ulimit -n
You can temporarily increase the limit in the current session: ulimit -n 4096
Log out and log back in or restart the system for the changes to take effect.
